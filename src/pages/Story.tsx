        The KIRK™ Collar was inspired by the loss of two lives in 2025 — Charlie Kirk and Iryna Zarutska. Both were attacked in separate
        incidents and died from neck injuries that may have been survivable had immediate intervention been available. We will not forget
        them. Their names live on — one on each side of every KIRK™ Collar.
